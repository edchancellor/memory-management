Memory Management Implementation in C

This following repository contains some memory management exercises in C. 
Essentially, each of the three folders contains a program which will implement Malloc and organise a 'free list' of available memory. 
One of these does so poorly by not merging adjacent free blocks, another does this better by merging adjacent blocks, and a third makes a slight optimisation by using multiple free lists.
